[[how-it-works]]
=== How does the agent work?
The Elastic APM iOS Agent uses the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-swift[OpenTelemetry-Swift SDK].
The agent automatically traces URLSessions and provides distributed traces annotated with device information along
with your back-end services instrumented with Open-Telemetry.
The agent also captures any custom open-telemetry traces or measurements created using the OpenTelemetry-Swift API.

=== Additional components
APM Agents work in conjunction with the {apm-guide-ref}/index.html[APM Server], {ref}/index.html[{es}], and {kibana-ref}/index.html[{kib}].
The {apm-guide-ref}/index.html[APM Guide] provides details on how these components work together,
and provides a matrix outlining {apm-guide-ref}/agent-server-compatibility.html[Agent and Server compatibility].
