  /// previous operations. The client handles the error response `UNAVAILABLE` case internally by

  /// definition for the data that may be available for processing. During `OnMessage` execution the
  /// `OpampClient` functions that change the status of the client may be called, e.g.: if RemoteConfig
  /// is processed then `OpampClient.setRemoteConfigStatus()` should be called to reflect the
  /// processing result. These functions may also be called after `onMessage` returns. This is advisable
